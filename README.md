# SynchronizationChecker
  These programs compute the length of the shortest synchronizing word for a given automaton. 
  Each one of these programs randomly generate a binary automaton with a finite number of states. Then it produces the DIMACS CNF format  depending on the Type of  the automaton and the class of synchronization required to check. 
check PFA synchronization program  is used to find the length of the shortest synchronizing word for a partial deterministic finite automaton (PFA) and Check NFA synchronization is used to find the length of the shortest synchronizing word for a nondeterministic finite  (NFA).

Another software that you  might need  is Mini-SAT as a SAT-solver.
